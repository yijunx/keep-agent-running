# Keep Agent Running - Project Runtime Engine

A DFS/BFS-based project runtime engine that orchestrates complex problem-solving through task decomposition, virtual environments, and collaborative execution.

## Architecture Overview

The system operates as a single engine that can run multiple projects, using a tree-based approach to break down complex queries into manageable tasks and execute them through various Virtual Environments (VEs) and human collaboration.

## Core Components

### ProjectRuntime

The main orchestration engine with the following key components:

```python
class ProjectRuntime:
    orchestration_models: str           # Key differentiator for performance across projects
    object_or_query: str               # Initial problem/query to solve
    tasks: list[Task]                  # Task queue (DFS/BFS execution)
    current_situation: Situation       # Current state of execution
    verifier: Verifier                 # Validation and verification logic
    things_to_respect: list[Any]       # Constraints and requirements

    # Resources
    ves_models: list[VE]               # Virtual Environments/Models available
    expert_allowed: list[User]         # Human experts that can be involved

    # Control & Monitoring
    stop_criteria: dict                # {token: 1000000, memory: xxx, queue_length: xxx}
    artifacts_generated: list[Artifacts] # Generated outputs
    configuration: PlanRuntimeConfig   # Runtime configuration
    execution_graph: TreeStructure    # Execution tree for tracking

    # Convergence Management (Industry-Inspired)
    convergence_manager: ConvergenceManager  # Multi-layered convergence control
    loop_prevention: LoopDetector      # Infinite loop detection and prevention
    context_manager: SharedContext     # Cross-agent knowledge sharing
```

### Execution Flow

#### 1. Initialization Phase
```
1. Engine starts with empty task queue
2. Analyzes object_or_query + things_to_respect
3. Selects appropriate VE (Virtual Environment)
4. Decomposes query into initial steps/tasks
5. Populates task queue
```

#### 2. Task Execution Phase (DFS/BFS Loop)
```
while tasks_queue is not empty and stop_criteria not met:
    1. Pick first task from queue
    2. Route to appropriate handler:
       - handle_task(Task, VE) for automated processing
       - handle_task(Task, Human) for human involvement
    3. Process task and generate artifacts
    4. Add new subtasks to queue (branching)
    5. Update execution graph
    6. Stream progress to users
```

### Task Handlers

#### Automated Task Handler
```python
def handle_task(task: Task, ve: VE) -> TaskResult:
    """
    Processes task through Virtual Environment

    Returns:
    - create_artifacts: Generated outputs
    - push_task_to_queue: New subtasks (branching)
    - stream_to_user: Progress updates
    """
```

#### Human Task Handler
```python
def handle_task(task: Task, human: User) -> TaskResult:
    """
    Handles tasks requiring human expertise

    Process:
    - Polls for human input/decisions
    - Manages timeouts and escalation
    - Integrates human feedback into workflow
    """
    while awaiting_human_input:
        try:
            result = poll_human_response()
            return process_human_input(result)
        except TimeoutException:
            handle_escalation()
```

## Task Convergence & Orchestration

*Inspired by industry leaders: OpenAI Swarm, Google ADK, Microsoft AutoGen, Cursor AI, and Claude Code*

### Multi-Layered Convergence Strategy

Based on research from leading AI companies, our system implements multiple convergence mechanisms:

```python
class ConvergenceManager:
    """Industry-inspired convergence control (OpenAI, Google, Microsoft patterns)"""

    # Termination Criteria (Multiple Exit Strategies)
    termination_conditions = {
        "resource_bounds": {"max_iterations": 100, "time_limit": 3600, "token_limit": 1000000},
        "quality_thresholds": {"goal_satisfaction": 0.95, "improvement_delta": 0.01},
        "consensus_based": {"checker_agent_approval": True, "stakeholder_signoff": False},
        "domain_constraints": {"natural_boundaries": [], "validation_rules": []}
    }

    # Loop Prevention (Cursor/Claude Code Pattern)
    loop_detection = {
        "state_revisit_limit": 3,
        "conversation_turn_cap": 50,
        "watchdog_timeouts": {"idle": 300, "stuck": 600},
        "escalation_triggers": ["resource_quota_exceeded", "infinite_recursion"]
    }
```

### Orchestration Patterns

#### 1. Hierarchical Control (Google ADK Style)
- **Parent-Child Chains**: Clear authority structure prevents chaos
- **Vertical Hand-offs**: Replace peer chatter with structured delegation
- **Goal Decomposition**: Maintain consistency through hierarchical task breakdown

#### 2. Context Sharing (Claude Code Pattern)
- **Shared Knowledge Base**: PROJECT.md equivalent for cross-agent standards
- **Incremental Context**: Each agent builds on previous work
- **Context Compression**: Aggressive state management for long sessions

#### 3. Parallel Execution (Cursor Inspired)
- **Concurrent Processing**: Up to 10 parallel agents with intelligent queuing
- **Background Tasks**: Push long-running tasks to background with notifications
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Adjust parallelism based on system load

### Industry-Proven Convergence Techniques

#### From Code Editors (Cursor/Claude Code)
```python
class DomainConstrainedConvergence:
    """Natural convergence through domain boundaries"""
    validation_layers = [
        "syntax_check",      # Basic correctness
        "logic_validation",  # Functional correctness
        "quality_gates",     # Standard compliance
        "integration_test",  # System correctness
        "stakeholder_review" # Human approval
    ]
```

#### From Multi-Agent Frameworks (AutoGen/CrewAI)
```python
class WorkflowOrchestration:
    patterns = {
        "sequential": "Linear dependencies with clear hand-offs",
        "maker_checker": "Iterative refinement loops with validation",
        "group_chat": "Limited to 3 agents for control",
        "hierarchical": "Orchestrator delegates to specialized agents"
    }
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Tree-Based Execution with Convergence Control
- **DFS/BFS Traversal**: Tasks executed with configurable search strategy
- **Dynamic Branching**: Controlled subtask creation with depth limits
- **State Tracking**: Full execution graph with loop detection
- **Bounded Search**: Resource limits prevent infinite expansion

### 2. Multi-Modal Processing with Context Isolation
- **Virtual Environments**: Specialized processing through various AI models
- **Human Integration**: Seamless escalation with timeout management
- **Hybrid Workflows**: Automated + human collaboration patterns
- **Context Boundaries**: Agent isolation prevents interference

### 3. Resource Management with Industry Best Practices
- **Multi-Level Stop Criteria**: Resource, quality, and consensus-based termination
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent VE distribution with cost optimization
- **Expert Scheduling**: Human availability management with escalation paths
- **Watchdog Systems**: Proactive detection of stuck/looping agents

### 4. Artifact Generation with Version Control
- **Structured Outputs**: Typed artifacts with metadata tracking
- **Evolution Tracking**: Complete artifact lineage through execution tree
- **Export Capabilities**: Multiple output formats with quality validation
- **Rollback Support**: Safe recovery from failed convergence attempts

## Configuration

### PlanRuntimeConfig
```python
class PlanRuntimeConfig:
    # Core Execution Strategy

    }

    # Resource Optimization (Based on Production Data)
    resource_limits: dict = {
        "token_budget": 1000000,     # Enterprise average
        "parallel_agents": 5,        # Optimal cost/performance
